            <h6>Calculator</h6>
            <p class="project-text">One of the first but fundamental programming skills that I was able to learn would
                be prototyping. Prototyping extends and becomes a structure on what you plan to make. Prototyping is
                what shines light and expands on ideas. This calculator assignment became a main basis for that. This
                assignment introduced the methods of JavaScript and how it can be used.
                <br>
                <br>
                At the start of every website, I was always taught to present a draft or prototype of the functions of
                the website. This prototype would also illustrate the design and purpose. Iterating became a major role
                in the development of any project. It allowed things to remain organized and made room for personal
                goals/progressions.
                <br>
                <br>
                Sites/softwares I used that were provided would be Figma and Canva. Figma is a wonderful site that
                provides me many preset dimensions, colors, and flexibility. Canva is an amazing site to provide
                templates for slide presentations and mood boards. These websites became wonderful sources in my CTE Web
                Application class.
                <br>
                <br>
                The first step in prototyping would be research. I would be tasked to go to different websites and take
                inspiration from them. If I was making a travel website, I looked at travel websites and what info was
                provided to users. Studying other websites is a crucial part of website development. It allows
                programmers to know exactly what to include, detail, and take out if necessary. After finding a layout
                and what to include, we would be tasked with creating mood boards to find a theme for the website.
                Generally, you’d want to find neutral vibrant colors that are modernistic. Of course all websites are
                different. But we were mainly tasked with creating websites for young adults. The last step would be
                image searching. There were many royalty free websites that were able to be referenced. Images were
                chosen based on idea and theme. A contrasting image would not make the website look nice. The
                prototyping process took the CART Habit of Mind “Investigate.” Jumping from site to site and taking in
                info is all part of the prototyping process.
