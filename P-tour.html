            <h6>Tourism Website</h6>
            <p class="project-text">A project that I created this year would be a tourism website. The purpose of this
                website was to attract a certain age group into learning more about the countries we chose. This project
                as whole included two extra group members to work with. Each member would choose their own countries.
                After the countries have been chosen, we were tasked into prototyping the layout of our website. We each
                had to include an about, discover, and travel. The website’s purpose did not include selling any
                tickets, it was strictly made to inform potential tourists.
<br>
<br>
                When we began prototyping on Figma, we made different perspectives of how we wanted our website to be
                layouted. We were able to take ideas from each of our prototypes and incorporate it harmoniously into
                our final design. We used examples from other travel websites to refine rough edges our prototype had.
                Here, we were also to choose on a monochrome type color scheme that seemed modern and neutral, a perfect
                combination for our targeted audience. During this prototyping process we also look for images to fit
                the mood or feel of our project.
                <br>
                <br>
                After getting our prototype approved, we began coding the main page of our website. We all were not
                familiar with flex-box, this made it very hard to stick to our original design. After the layout of our
                main page was finished, we copied and pasted it on the other nine pages that we needed to complete (3
                per person). This layout would be a guide/template that we made to aid us in a consistent design.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although the finished product looked amazing, there were a lot of speed bumps along the way. We had to
                incorporate methods of JavaScript to include certain elements (We haven’t been introduced as a class on
                how to use JS at this time). While my group members worked on the hamburger menu, I worked on the
                image-carousel. The image carousel kept breaking text and images, but I was able to find a solution
                after hours of troubleshooting. The remaining group member worked on his own page and checked with the
                other pages to see if it coaligned with the format. During this project I was able to inherit and apply
                the CART Habit of Mind “Investigate.” Going through each bit of code and making sure that nothing
                overlapped with each other was a meticulous task that could not be overlooked. Three people working on
                the same file was very chaotic, but it was a nice experience that can be expected in all future group
                projects.
