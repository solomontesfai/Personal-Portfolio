                    <p class="lead">
                        Hello! I am a current student at Clovis Community College indulging myself in the studies of
                        engineering. I have always been fascinated with technology. I have passions about being involved
                        in innovations that can ultimately change people's lives for the good. I believe pursuing a
                        career in engineering and immersing myself in this field, will allow me to be involved in the
                        future of technology.
<br>
<br>

                        To support this future, I have spent my last two years of high school participating in the CART
                        program. CART is a separate school that houses several ROP courses in different fields of
                        studies. At CART, I was able to take an engineering and web applications class. Simultaneously,
                        I was taking AP Computer Science and Principles at my home school.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Engineering introduced me to 3D-modeling CAD software. Web Applications dove into the hidden
                        field of UX. Here, I was able to learn fundamental objectives when creating products or
                        material. I was also taught how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a website or game.
                        Computer Science Principles educated me on the relationship of society and coding.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        I plan on continuing this study at community college. Although Electrical and Electronics
                        engineering is what I am striving for, engineering has a variety of branches that I may find an
                        interest in. I love how engineering is connected in such a way, and I plan on using the skills I
                        learned to pursue a potential future in the science of engineering.
