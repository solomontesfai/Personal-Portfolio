                    Hello! I am a current student at Clovis Community College indulging myself in the studies of
                    engineering. I have always been fascinated with technology. I have passions about being involved
                    in innovations that can ultimately change people's lives for the better. I believe pursuing a
                    career in engineering and immersing myself in this field, will allow me to be involved in the
                    future of technology.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    To support this future, I have spent my last two years of high school participating in the CART
                    program. CART is a separate school that houses several ROP courses in different fields of
                    studies. At CART, I was able to take an engineering and web applications class. Simultaneously,
                    I was taking AP Computer Science and Principles at my home school.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Engineering introduced me to 3D-modeling CAD software. Web Applications dove into the hidden
                    field of UX. Here, I was able to learn fundamental objectives when creating products or
                    material. I was also taught how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a website or game.
                    Computer Science Principles educated me on the relationship of society and coding.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    I plan on continuing this study at community college. Although Electrical and Electronics
                    engineering is what I am striving for, engineering has a variety of branches that I may find an
                    interest in. I love how engineering is connected in such a way, and I plan on using the skills I
                    learned to pursue a potential future in the science of engineering.
                    <br>

                    Thank you for your time and consideration. Please help yourself in exploring the other pages in
                    my portfolio to learn more about my experiences, personality, and examples of work I’ve done in
                    the past.
