            <p class="project-text">A valuable programming skill that I was able to learn would be problem solving.
                Problem solving is a skill that is always used in programming. It is an inquisitive yet tedious process.
                A process that gives the programmer the best satisfaction when solved.

                <br>
                Websites that I’ve developed all went through this process. Whether it was a missing bracket or a simple
                comma, these instances make a huge impact on the overall functionality of the website at hand. An
                example of this would be the INteractive Sotry Website. THe only reason why me and my group mate's code
                was not working was due to a simple spelling error. Technically it wasn't even a spelling error. THe
                JavaScript read my code in 'options,' whilst it read her code as 'option.' Pretty funny innit? Not to
                mention there is a website validation process that is needed to recognize the website that is created as
                an actual website. This validation process is crucial in detecting any malicious intent and ensuring
                that the website that is being published will upload as the user intends it to.
                <br>
                <br>
                The first website I made gave me all of this trouble. For this website, we the students were challenged
                in our fluency and knowledge of HTML and CSS. There were many times where I would input the wrong ID or
                forget to close off a statement. These mistakes would lead on to countless hours and nights of looking
                line after line. This website definitely encouraged me to be more organized the next time. The
                validation process was a sea of red errors. There were many empty statements/invalid ID names. This
                website truly exercises my CART habit of mind, “Connect.” Connecting and identifying relationships of
                statements in correspondence to CSS definitely was a major part of this website. Connecting is a major
                part of problem solving, it can be hand in hand with persistence and investigating.
