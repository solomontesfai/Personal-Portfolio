            <p class="project-text">Throughout my time at CART, I’ve developed several websites using methods of CSS and
                HTML. I’ve demonstrated this knowledge and fluency of my skills in website development projects.
                Although I’ve done quite a few, the one I will be focusing on right now would be the first website I
                coded whilst learning HTML and CSS. The instructors tasked each student to develop a tourism website.
                There were a ton of prerequisites that we had to research before we even started to code. We had to
                study the targeted audience, color palette, prototype, functionality, and the rationality of what we
                were trying to implement.
                <br>
                <br>
                After all of the essentials were met, I was excited to begin my code. I opened up the HTML assignment on
                visual studio code and didn’t know where to begin. I realized that I was in a whole different type of
                work environment. So like anyone would, I asked my teachers, peers, and youtube for help. I was able to
                rebound quickly and immerse myself in the field of trial and error with coding.
                <br>
                <br>
                The biggest obstacle I had to go through would be correlating CSS with HTML. There were certain syntaxes
                I’d forgotten so I was a bit slower incorporating CSS. There were so many different styling options that
                I wanted to try everything too. I wanted to do my best to incorporate everything but it resulted in a
                lot of wasted time. However, I plan on using the hardship I encountered as a strength in developing more
                websites. I’ve developed the importance of the CART Habit of Mind “Persistence.”
